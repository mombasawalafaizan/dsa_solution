'''Another method:
USING difference OF NODE COUNTS d = abs(c1-c2)   O(m+n) time complexity'''
# a) Get count of the nodes in the first list, let count be c1.
# b) Get count of the nodes in the second list, let count be c2.
# c) Get the difference of counts d = abs(c1 â€“ c2)
# d) Now traverse the bigger list from the first node till d nodes 
#    so that from here onwards both the lists have equal no of nodes.
# e) Then we can traverse both the lists in parallel till we come across 
#    a common node. (Note that getting a common node is done by comparing the address of the nodes)
