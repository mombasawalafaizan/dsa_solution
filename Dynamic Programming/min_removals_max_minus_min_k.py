# More optimized version using DP
# As outer loop is going to make n interations. And the inner loop iterates at max n times for all
# outer iterations. Because we start value of j from dp[i-1] and loops it until it reaches i and
# then for the next element we again start from the previous dp[i] value. So the total time complexity
# is O(n) if we donâ€™t consider the complexity of the sorting as it is not considered in the above solution
# as well.
