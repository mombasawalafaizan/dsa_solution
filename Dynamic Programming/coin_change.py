# Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply of each of
# S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins, how many ways can we make the change?
# The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.
# For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions:
# {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. So output should be 4.
# For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions:
# {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}. So the output should be 5.

# NOTE: This problem is not SAME as MAKE CHANGE problem. In this problem, we want to
# find the number of possible changes whereas in MAKE CHANGE, we have to identify the
# number of coins in the best possible change.

# Time Complexity: O(mn) and Space Complexity: O(mn)
